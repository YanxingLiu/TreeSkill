## P0 - Critical

- [ ] **Unify the main optimization path onto the newer multi-step optimizer**
  
  The CLI still uses `APOEngine`, which performs a single optimization cycle.
  The newer `TrainFreeOptimizer` in `evoskill/core/optimizer.py` supports multi-step optimization.
  
  **Files to update**:
  - `evoskill/cli.py` - migrate from `APOEngine` to `TrainFreeOptimizer`
  - `evoskill/optimizer.py` - consider deprecating or integrating with core optimizer
  - `evoskill/core/optimizer.py` - ensure it's production-ready
  
  **Notes**: `APOEngine` is still functional but doesn't leverage the full TGD loop with `max_steps`.

- [ ] **Implement automatic few-shot example construction from high-quality traces**
  
  `few_shot_messages` exists in the schema, but there is no pipeline that promotes strong traces into reusable examples.
  
  **Proposed workflow**:
  1. Identify high-scoring traces (score > 0.8)
  2. Extract user input + ideal response as Message pair
  3. Add to `few_shot_messages` with version tracking
  4. Limit to top-K examples to avoid context bloat
  
  **Files to update**:
  - `evoskill/schema.py` - add example extraction metadata
  - `evoskill/skill.py` - add `promote_to_few_shot()` method
  - `evoskill/core/optimizer.py` - integrate into optimization loop

## P1 - Important

- [ ] **Add automatic routing for skill trees**
  
  Users currently have to manually switch sub-skills with `/select`; there is no automatic leaf selection based on user input.
  
  **Proposed solution**: Implement a router that analyzes user input and selects the most appropriate leaf skill automatically.
  
  **Files to update**:
  - `evoskill/cli.py` - add auto-routing before message compilation
  - `evoskill/skill_tree.py` - add `route(input_text: str) -> SkillNode` method
  - `evoskill/core/tree_optimizer.py` - potentially use LLM for routing decision

- [ ] **Add hard thresholds for auto split and auto prune decisions**
  
  The current structure evolution relies heavily on LLM judgment and needs statistical guardrails.
  
  **Proposed thresholds**:
  - Split: minimum 5 samples with contradictory feedback patterns
  - Prune: performance < 0.3 for 3+ consecutive rounds, usage_count < 2
  - Protection: newly created nodes protected for 2 rounds (already implemented)
  
  **Files to update**:
  - `evoskill/core/tree_optimizer.py` - add threshold checks in `analyze_split_need()` and `analyze_prune_need()`
  - `evoskill/core/optimizer_config.py` - add threshold configuration options

- [ ] **Complete the automatic merge workflow for skill trees**
  
  `SkillTree.merge()` exists, but there is no full merge analysis, trigger path, or CLI/product flow around it.
  
  **Missing pieces**:
  - Merge detection logic (when should merge be suggested?)
  - CLI command `/merge` with interactive flow
  - Merge preview showing combined prompt
  
  **Files to update**:
  - `evoskill/skill_tree.py` - enhance `merge()` with analysis
  - `evoskill/core/tree_optimizer.py` - add `analyze_merge_need()`
  - `evoskill/cli.py` - add `/merge` command

## P2 - Nice to Have

- [ ] **Improve storage concurrency safety**
  
  The current JSONL append model may fail under multi-process usage and likely needs file locking or a different backend.
  
  **Proposed solutions**:
  - Add file locking with `fcntl` (Unix) or `msvcrt` (Windows)
  - Consider SQLite backend for high-concurrency scenarios
  - Add atomic write operations
  
  **Files to update**:
  - `evoskill/storage.py` - add locking mechanism
  - `evoskill/config.py` - add storage backend configuration

- [ ] **Expand multimodal failure analysis beyond placeholder handling**
  
  Multimodal optimization support exists at a basic level, but detailed content-aware feedback analysis is still incomplete.
  
  **Missing features**:
  - Image content analysis in gradient computation
  - Audio transcription integration for feedback analysis
  - Multimodal few-shot example extraction
  
  **Files to update**:
  - `evoskill/core/optimizer.py` - enhance `compute_gradient()` for multimodal
  - `evoskill/core/abc.py` - add multimodal-specific methods to `ModelAdapter`

## P1 - Important (Skill Ecosystem)

- [ ] **Remote skill loading from GitHub**

  Load skills directly from GitHub repositories without manual cloning.

  **Proposed usage**:
  ```bash
  python -m evoskill.main --skill github://user/repo/path/to/skill
  ```
  Or in CLI:
  ```
  /fetch user/repo/skills/writing-assistant
  ```

  **Implementation**:
  - Use `git clone --depth 1 --sparse` to fetch only the skill directory
  - Cache downloaded skills locally in `~/.evoskill/cache/`
  - Support version pinning via branch/tag (`github://user/repo@v1.0/path`)

  **Files to create/update**:
  - `evoskill/remote.py` - remote skill fetching and caching
  - `evoskill/main.py` - handle `github://` scheme in `--skill`
  - `evoskill/cli.py` - add `/fetch` command

- [ ] **Publish optimized skills**

  One-click export/publish of APO-optimized skills to share with the community.

  **Proposed usage**:
  ```
  /publish              # push to configured GitHub repo
  /export-skill ./out/  # export as standard Agent Skills directory
  ```

  **Key value**: Other platforms share hand-written skills; EvoSkill shares **automatically optimized** skills -- this is the differentiator.

  **Files to create/update**:
  - `evoskill/publish.py` - skill packaging and GitHub push
  - `evoskill/cli.py` - add `/publish` and `/export-skill` commands

## Notes

- **v0.2 architecture**: The new `evoskill/core/` package provides clean abstractions (`ModelAdapter`, `OptimizablePrompt`, `TrainFreeOptimizer`)
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy `evo_framework/` still works with deprecation warnings
- **YAML encoding**: `skill.save()` uses `allow_unicode=True` for readable Chinese
- **Configuration priority**: Environment variables > `.env` > YAML config > defaults
